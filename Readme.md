🔥 FLAMES Relationship Calculator
The FLAMES Relationship Calculator is a fun web-based mini project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It predicts the relationship between two people based on their names using the classic childhood game "FLAMES".

⚠️ Note
This tool is purely for fun and entertainment purposes.
The result does not reflect real-life relationships or emotions. Real relationships depend on trust, understanding, and communication — not the letters in your name!

✨ What is FLAMES?
FLAMES is an acronym that stands for:
F – Friends
L – Love
A – Affection
M – Marriage
E – Enemies
S – Siblings

The game works by:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Taking two names as input.
Removing common characters.
Counting the total remaining characters.
Using that count to eliminate letters from “FLAMES” in a cycle until one remains.
The final letter determines the result.
